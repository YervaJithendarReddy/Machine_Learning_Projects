# **HR Attrition Prediction**

## **Overview**
This project aims to build a predictive model to understand the factors contributing to employee attrition and predict the likelihood of employees leaving an organization. It helps businesses take proactive measures to retain talent and reduce turnover costs.

## **Key Features**
- Predicts employee attrition using machine learning techniques.
- Performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify important trends and patterns.
- Incorporates feature engineering to optimize the dataset for better model performance.
- Provides insights into factors influencing employee turnover.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools/Platforms:** Jupyter Notebook, Flask (optional for deployment)
- **Version Control:** GitHub

## **Dataset Description**
- **Source:** Provide details or a link to the dataset source if publicly available.
- **Size:** *e.g., 20 columns, X rows*
- **Key Features:** Briefly describe key features of the dataset, such as demographic details, job satisfaction, and performance indicators.

## **Methodology**
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Analyzed patterns like correlation, attrition trends, and employee characteristics.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Selected and engineered key predictors for better model accuracy.
4. **Model Development:** Used *e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods*.
5. **Evaluation Metrics:** Achieved *e.g., 87% accuracy* with reduced false positives by *e.g., 16%*.

# Healthcare Classification Prediction Project

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting healthcare outcomes using machine learning techniques. By leveraging patient data, the model classifies conditions (e.g., disease diagnosis, risk assessment) to assist in better decision-making. 

The project is built with **Python** and integrates key libraries for data preprocessing, visualization, and modeling.

## ðŸ“Š Key Features

- **Data Analysis**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and trends in the healthcare dataset.  
- **Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and dealing with outliers.
- **Model Building**: Implementation of classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- **Evaluation**: Comprehensive model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

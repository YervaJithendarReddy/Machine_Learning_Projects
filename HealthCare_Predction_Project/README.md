# Healthcare Classification Prediction Project

# Problem Statement:

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to assess a patient's health condition based on various medical and demographic features. The model aims to classify the health status into one of three categories: Normal, Abnormal, or Inconclusive.

The solution will leverage patient data, including vital signs, diagnostic results, and medical history, to assist healthcare providers in prioritizing attention to critical cases and improving decision-making efficiency. The model should achieve high accuracy while ensuring interpretability to gain trust from healthcare professionals.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting healthcare outcomes using machine learning techniques. By leveraging patient data, the model classifies conditions (e.g., disease diagnosis, risk assessment) to assist in better decision-making. 

The project is built with **Python** and integrates key libraries for data preprocessing, visualization, and modeling.

## ðŸ“Š Key Features

- **Data Analysis**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and trends in the healthcare dataset.  
- **Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and dealing with outliers.
- **Model Building**: Implementation of classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- **Evaluation**: Comprehensive model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
- **Deployment**: Deployed the model after training using Streamlit(a python library) to transfer the model from an Development enviroment to Production Environment
